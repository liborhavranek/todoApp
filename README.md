# ToDo List

In my ToDo list can user registred and have owen list 
with tasks.

The ToDo list allows users to register and create their own list of tasks. Each task has a title, description, creation date, and planned completion date. If the task is completed, it will also include a completion date.

The list of tasks is sorted by the expiration date, and tasks that have passed their expiration date will be marked with a red title "expired". If a completed task has an expiration date after the deadline, it will be marked with the title "you can delete task".

Each task has its own page with detailed information about it. If a task is completed, the button will change color and allow the user to mark it as incomplete again. The task's status can be either "complete" or "incomplete" and can be changed by the user as needed.
